# Docker & Kubernetes


### What is Docker ? 

- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

### Benefits: 

- Caching a cluster of containers
- Flexible resource sharing
- Scalability - many containers can be placed in a single host
- Running your service on hardware that is much cheaper than - standard servers
- Fast deployment, ease of creating new instances, and faster migrations.
- Ease of moving and maintaining your applications
- Better security, less access needed to work with the code running inside containers, and fewer software dependencies



### Microservices architecture 

- A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.
